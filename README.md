# Projects
"Projects" is a project management tool web app.
Completing the project is not the purpose of this project. But instead, a bonus if it happens.

## Then what is the purpose?
The purpose of this project is to get more familiar with testing in JavaScript/TypeScript.
Also, to avoid multiple node_module directories, both
 the front- and backend, use the same package.json.

## Testing
The aim is to have at least 80% test coverage, in the front- and backend combined.
Both the use the setup provided for testing in Angular, for the sake of making the setup less bothersome.
