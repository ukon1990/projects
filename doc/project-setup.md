This project's frontend was generated with the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli). 
To install it run ``npm i -g @angular/cli``.

The backend uses [Serverless](https://serverless.com/). To install it run `npm i -g serverless`.

## Development server
The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Frontend
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

### Backend
Run `npm run start-lambda` for a dev server. It will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Code scaffolding
### Frontend
Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build
### Frontend
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io). This will run tests on both the frontend and the backend. 
To run it with code coverage do `npm run test` or `ng test --code-coverage`.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
